              Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
              It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
              Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
        
              Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
              work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
              Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
